Steven Siwei Ye and Oscar Hernan Madrid Padilla. Non-parametric quantile regression via the K-NN fused lasso.

# Codes
*  linear programming 
*  ADMM and ADMM with BIC model selection
*  Majorize-Minimize

Note that all algorithms require the usage of nearestneighbour.m by Richard Brown. See details in https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/12574-nearestneighbour-m.

For ADMM, we use parametric max-flow algorithm from "On Total Variation Minimization and Surface Evolution Using Parametric Maximum Flows" by Antonin Chambolle and Jérôme Darbon. Users need to compile "tvexact" to enable the "graphtv" function.

# Datasets 
*  California housing data
*  Chicago crime data
